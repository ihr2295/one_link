## User Experience (UX) <a name="ux"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

### Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

The main business goal for Network Blog is to provide users with a blog-style website with various topics, covering different technologies, accessible for the user to view. The user can create an account to be able to further interact with these blog posts via likes and adding comments.

The main target audience for this website are other network engineers who enjoy new challenges and study new technologies, experiencing a wide type of topics and following case studies, laboratories and configuration discussions, from different levels of knowledge. This is also a website for users to be able to share their comments and reviews about opinions and experiences with the community.

## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Colours <a name="colours"></a>

I have used white for the overall background colour for the website, accompanied by black and #212529 for the header and footer to notably distinguish this from the main content.

For the text, black has been used against the white background and white has been used against the black header and footer. This opposite contrast has been chosen for ease of visibility, so users are able to read the text without any additional difficulty.

In addition, cornflowerblue colour has been used as a complementing accent to the website for the logo and hover links without causing any distractions to the user viewing the website.


### Typography <a name="typography"></a>

The fonts were obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

More specifically, Roboto and Lato fonts were used for this project, they are very similar and work very well togheter, giving the user an organic view of the page text.

For my logo text I have used Roboto.

For the heading text I have used Lato.

I have avoided using overly stylised fonts, which can be difficult to read for users, therefore ensuring the website is more accessible to users with visual impairments.

In the event the font fails to load, I have used sans-serif as a back-up font.


### Imagery <a name="imagery"></a>

Images are obtained from AI Image Creator Microsoft Bing with Dall-E 3 integration [Microsoft Bing](https://www.bing.com/images/create) website.

I have used imagery appropriate to the websiteâ€™s content to provide a more visual experience to the user.

All the images used in this project were generated by me.


## Skeleton <a name="skeleton"></a>

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

Wireframes were created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/).

The wireframes have examples of desktop, tablet, and mobile phone displays.

* [Home](docs/images/home.png)
* [About Me](docs/images/about-me.png)
* [Blog Post](docs/images/blog-post.png)
* [Register](docs/images/register.png)
* [Login](docs/images/login.png)

Overall, the finished project design is similar to what I had originally intended to create as per my wireframes. However, there are some minor differences on the blog post section with the arrangement of the content.


### Database <a name="database"></a>

A relational database was used for this project.

During production SQLite/Postgres was used as the main database, and for deployment all data was migrated to Heroku Postgres.

Please note that for testing purposes SQLite database was used. In the settings.py code was added to allow for the databases to be swtiched between SQLite for testing and Postgres for regular production. When DEVELOPMENT = True, then the SQLite database will be used for testing, and when this is set to False, then the Postgres database will be in use.

![](docs/images/db-scheme.png)

The database diagram was created using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home).

The database contains the following models, once of which is a custom model - Contact.

* __Post__: Contains information about posts submitted by admin, has a relationship with the User model.
* __Comment__: Contains information about comments submitted by the user, has a relationship with the Post model.
* __Contact__: Contains information about form submitted by a site visitor, has no external relationships with other models.
* __User__: Contains information about the user, this is a Django built-in model, has a relationship with the Post model.

### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

Due to hard time constraints, I was unable to apply additional features, in the future I would like to implement the following:

* Allow users to edit/delete their own posted comments. Verification would need to be added to ensure that the user is only able to edit/delete their own comments and be restricted from amending any other users' comments.

* Allow users to create their own posts, this would go to Admin for approval to ensure that the content is consistent and appropriate to the website.

* Add a Lab section on the blog, providing scenarios and startup-config for the devices to test for every laboratory, allowing the users to challenge their skills and knowledge.

* Add a tick list on the blog lab section for the posts. This will allow users to tick off against each of the lab task to signify which items the user completed and which they do not.

* Add a 404 page.

### User Stories Testing <a name="user-testing"></a>

From the Home page, the user is presented with the navigation which consists of the Network Blog name, Home button, Sign Up button, Login button, About Me button, Contact Me button and on the right-hand side is the search bar with the Search button. Each of these buttons are operational, the user can click or utilise. The following actions will occur once the user clicks the following buttons:

* Network Blog Name -> Defaults to the Home page, user can click this to take them back to the Home page
* Home button -> Links to the Home page, user can click this to take them back to the Home page
* About Me button -> Links to the About Me page, user can click this to take them to the About Me page

* Contact Me button -> Links to the Contact Me page, user can click this to take them to the Contact Me page
* Search button -> Links to the Search page, user can only click this once the search criteria has been met (cannot be blank and a minimum of 2 characters), this will then allow for the form to be submitted

![](docs/images/search-min-char.png)

The user can easily access the navigation as this is fixed at the top of the page and is accessible from all the pages of the website. On desktop view the navigation can be viewed in full but in mobile view this then collapses the post images are not showed.

![](docs/images/usertest-nav.png)

The main section of the Home page displays the posted posts, there is a max of 6 posts displayed per page. The user can navigate between the post pages by clicking Next button to go to the next page to view more posts or clicking Prev button to go to the previous page. The posts are displayed in date order, the most recent posts are displayed first and the older posts will be displayed at the very end (or on a different page if exceeding 6 posts per page). Each post is presented with a card style with an imagine, the author, post title, post description, posted date and time, and a like count. The user can select any post from the available posts by clicking the post title or description. This action will take the user to the post post page of that particular post.

![](docs/images/usertest-home1.png)

![](docs/images/usertest-home2.png)

At the bottom of the page is the footer. The footer is present and can be accessed from any page of the website. The footer provides social media links to the user which they are able to click to take them to the respective social media platforms. The social media links open in a new tab once clicked, this provides for a better user experience as the original website is not lost and the user is able to easily navigate back from where they left off. Further down from there is the copyright text for the website.

![](docs/images/usertest-footer.png)

The following user stories have been achieved from this section:

* As a Site User I can click on a post so that I can read the full text.
* As a Site User I can view a list of posts so that I can select one to read.
* As a Site User I can locate their social media accounts so I can receive updates and see their following and how well they are known and reliable.
* As a Site User I can navigate easily through the site and find the relevant information with ease.

Selecting the About Me button from the navigation will take the user to the About Me page. The page is simple and it has a section with text the user is able to read. From here the user is able to find out more information about the website and the aim of Network Blog.

![](docs/images/usertest-about.png)

The following user stories have been achieved from this section:

* As a Site User I can learn more about the site the purpose of the web app.

Selecting the Sign Up button from the navigation will take the user to the Sign Up page. This page can also be accessed by clicking the links available on the Login page. The page shows the Sign Up section, any existing users with an account are prompted to go to the login page provided from the link. Any new users are prompted to enter the required details to be able to sign up. The fields username, password and password (again) are required fields, therefore the user cannot submit a blank form for these. However the email is an optional field as stated on the form, therefore the user does not need to enter this to sign up to become a member.

![](docs/images/usertest-signup.png)

If the password section does not match for both fields, then the user will be presented with a message to state that they must type the same password each time to be able to create the account.

![](docs/images/usertest-error1.png)

If the password is too similar to the username the user will also be displayed with an error message. This is a security feature on the form to ensure the user's account cannot be acessed easily by creating a different and strong password.

![](docs/images/usertest-error2.png)

Once the sign up form fields have been successfully filled out and the user clicks the sign up button, then the user will be taken back to the Hope page and an alert message will be displayed at the top (below the navigation) to indicate that the user is signed is as their 'username' name. The navigation will now be updated to remove Sign Up and Login buttons with the Logout button.

![](docs/images/usertest-nav2.png)

Alternatively for any existing users with an account already created, by selecting the Login button from the button, this will take the user to the Login page. The link is also accessed from the sign up page for existing users. The page shows the Login section, any new users are prompted to go to the sign up page provided from the link. Any existing users are prompted to enter the required details to be able to login. The user is required to enter their username and password which they previously used to create the account. The user also has an option to tick the 'Remeber Me' checkbox.

Once the user has entered the relevant details and clicked the login button to submit the form, they will be taken back to the Home page and an alert will be displayed at the top of the page (below the navigation) to notify the user that they have logged in successfully. The navigation bar will be changed once logged in as described above in a previous point.

Logged in users have the option to Logout from their account by selecting the Logout button from the navigation. By selecting the Logout button this will take the user to the Logout page. A message prompts the user to confirm if they wish to sign out. Selecting the sign out button will confirm this choice and the user will be taken back to the Home page, and an alter will be displayed to confirm that the user has signed out. Users who do not wish to logout can click back to the Home page from the navigation (or any other page) to undo this action.

![](docs/images/usertest-signout.png)


Users with an account that are logged in have the option to add comments and like posts on the post detail page once a post is selected.

The main section of the post post is exactly the same for logged in users as is for users who are not logged in. The post title, author, time and date and image are displayed at the top. Then further down is the main post body. At the end of the section, there is a like counter and comment counter displayed which will show how many users have liked the post and how many comments does a post have.

![](docs/images/usertest-post.png)

With likes and comments:

![](docs/images/usertest-likes1.png)

With no likes and comments:

![](docs/images/usertest-likes2.png)

After the main post post, logged in users will be displayed with the comments section (on the left) where any posted comments which have been approved by the admin can be viewed, and the comment box (on the right) where the user can submit a comment. The comment box is only available for logged in users, whereas the comments section is visible to both logged in users and users not logged in.

Logged in user view:

![](docs/images/usertest-post2.png)

Generic view for non-members:

![](docs/images/usertest-post3.png)

The comment box provides details to the user as to who they are posting as which corresponds to the username they have logged in with. Further down is the main comment body section where the user is able to enter a comment. Once clicking the submit button, the user will be presented with an alert message to state that the comment has been sent for approval. Only the admin can approve comments. Once the admin has approved the comment, this can now be viewed on the post post.

![](docs/images/usertest-comment.png)

![](docs/images/usertest-comment2.png)

The logged in user is also able to like a post by clicking the heart icon, this will increase the like count by 1. Alternatively, the user can also unlike the post by clicking on the heart icon again which will decrease the count by 1.

The following user stories have been achieved from this section:

__Admin Only User Story Testing__

This section tests the user stories for the Admin only functions of the website.

The admin section is accessed by entering '/admin' at the end of the url for the website. This displayed the login page for the admin from which they can login.

The admin username for this project is: **sonj79**

![](docs/images/usertest-admin.png)

The site admin has various actions available to be able to manage the website such as:

* Delete users

The admin can also create new posts by selecting the Add Post button. This will open up the editor page which will allow the fields to be populated. The status of the post can also be toggled between Draft or Published. The Published posts can then be viewed on the website, whereas Draft posts cannot.

The admin also has the capability to create, edit and delete posts via the front end of the website.

When logged in as admin, from the navigation the admin has an additional link available 'Add Post'.

Selecting the 'Add Post' link will direct the admin to add a post page. From here the admin can enter the relevant details on the form to submit the form to add a new post to the website. The admin can select whether to create this post as a draft or publish this straight away. Any published posts can be viewed on the home page, and any draft posts can be accessed in the admin section and approved later once editing is completed.

Submitting the form will direct the admin to the home page with a success message.

The admin also has the capability to edit or delete posts. These are displayed on each post on the homepage. If delete option is selected then the post is deleted from the database and this is confirmed via an alert message.

The following user stories have been achieved from this section:

* As a Site Admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments
* As a Site Admin I can create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later
* As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my blog content
* As a Site Admin I can prevent unauthorised users from having access so that they cannot access admin content or other users' profiles


### Automated Testing <a name="auto-testing"></a>

Further testing was completed importing the Django TestCase. The test files can be located in the blog > tests folder for the project, this consists of the following files:

* test_forms.py
* test_models.py
* test_urls.py
* test_views.py

![](docs/images/tests-passed.png)

From the picture above, it is clear all the ptests are passed.

Please note that for testing purposes SQLite database was used. In the settings.py code was added to allow for the databases to be swtiched between SQLite for testing and Postgres for regular production. When DEVELOPMENT = True, then the SQLite database will be used for testing, and when this is set to False, then the Postgres database will be in use.

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

The project was developed using GitPod and was deployed via the GitHub repository to Heroku.

The following steps were followed to deploy this project:

1. From the Heroku dashboard, select 'New' in the top right-hand corner.
2. Click 'Create new app'.
3. Enter the app name and choose region as Europe.
4. Click 'Create app'.
5. Select the 'Settings' tab, and scroll down to 'Buildpacks'.
6. Add 'Python' and save changes.
7. Scroll down to 'Config Vars' section, and add the 'KEY' and 'VALUE' for the CLOUDINARY_URL, DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to run the app.
8. At the top of the page, click on the 'Deploy' section.
9. Select Github as deployment method.
10. Select 'Connect to Github', and locate the repository name and click on 'Connect' to link my Heroku app to my Github repository code.
11. To add the Postgres Database, click on the 'Resources' tab.
12. Under Add-ons, search for 'Heroku Postgres', click on the search result for this.
13. Select the 'Hobby Dev-Free' option and click submit order form which will add this to the Add-ons section.
14. Scroll further down, select 'Enable Automatic Deploys' and then select 'Deploy Branch' to deploy project.
15. After it has successfully deployed a 'view' button appears on screen and when clicked opens the deployed application.

Please note as of 18/04/2022, Heroku no longer allows deployment from GitHub and is currently under maintenance. As a workaround the following method is used using the GitPod terminal to deploy any further changes to Heroku.

* Run the command heroku login -i and login when prompted. Then run the following command: heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
* After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command git push heroku main and your app will be deployed to Heroku.

### Code

* To build the search functionality for the website, code from the following [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGtae4L5BbI) video tutorial was used to assist with this.

* A large part of this project code was used and inspired from the Code Institute's I Think Therefore I Blog walkthrough to be able to build a base skeleton project. Please note some of the borrowed code has been customised by me to fit this project. I have also added my own code for additional functions for the project.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to help with styling and overall responsivness of the website.

* To assist with the unit testing section of the project, Code Institute's Hello Django Testing tutorial section was utilised as well as the following [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwypH3YvMKc&list=PLbpAWbHbi5rMF2j5n6imm0enrSD9eQUaM&index=1) resource.
